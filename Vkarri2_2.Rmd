Question 1

## Decision Variables

- \(X\): Number of Collegiate backpacks to produce per week.
- \(Y\): Number of Mini backpacks to produce per week.

## Objective Function

Maximize the total profit (\(Z\)):

\[Z = 32X + 24Y\]

## Constraints

1. Material Constraint:

\[
3X + 2Y \leq 5000
\]

2. Sales Constraints:

\[
X \leq 1000
\]

\[
Y \leq 1200
\]

3. Labor Constraint:

\[
45X + 40Y \leq 35 \times 40 \times 60
\]

4. Non-negativity Constraints:

\[
X \geq 0
\]

\[
Y \geq 0
\]

# Solution using R
```{r}
library(lpSolve)

# Define the objective function coefficients
obj_coef <- c(32, 24)

# Define the matrix of constraint coefficients
mat_coef <- matrix(c(3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 45, 40), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# Define the right-hand side of constraints
rhs <- c(5000, 1000, 1200, 35 * 40 * 60)

# Define the constraint types (<=)
con_types <- rep("<=", length(rhs))

# Solve the linear programming problem
lp_result <- lp("max", obj_coef, mat_coef, con_types, rhs)

# Print the solution
cat("Collegiate backpacks to produce per week:", lp_result$solution[1], "\n")
cat("Mini backpacks to produce per week:", lp_result$solution[2], "\n")
cat("Maximum profit per week:", lp_result$objval, "\n")
```



Question 2

## Decision Variables

Let's define the decision variables:
- \(X_1\): The number of large-sized units produced at Plant 1.
- \(X_2\): The number of medium-sized units produced at Plant 2.
- \(X_3\): The number of small-sized units produced at Plant 3.

## Objective Function

Maximize the total profit (\(Z\)):
\[Z = 420X_1 + 360X_2 + 300X_3\]

## Constraints

1. Capacity Constraints:
   - Plant 1 can produce up to 750 units per day.
   - Plant 2 can produce up to 900 units per day.
   - Plant 3 can produce up to 450 units per day.
   \[X_1 \leq 750\]
   \[X_2 \leq 900\]
   \[X_3 \leq 450\]

2. Storage Space Constraints:
   - Plant 1 has 13,000 square feet of in-process storage space.
   - Plant 2 has 12,000 square feet of in-process storage space.
   - Plant 3 has 5,000 square feet of in-process storage space.
   - Each unit of the large, medium, and small sizes produced per day requires 20, 15, and 12 square feet, respectively.
   \[20X_1 + 15X_2 + 12X_3 \leq 13,000\]
   \[20X_1 + 15X_2 + 12X_3 \leq 12,000\]
   \[20X_1 + 15X_2 + 12X_3 \leq 5,000\]

3. Sales Forecasts:
   - Sales forecasts indicate that if available, 900, 1,200, and 750 units of the large, medium, and small sizes, would be sold per day.
   \[X_1 \leq 900\]
   \[X_2 \leq 1200\]
   \[X_3 \leq 750\]

4. Non-negativity Constraints:
   \[X_1 \geq 0\]
   \[X_2 \geq 0\]
   \[X_3 \geq 0\]

5. Percentage constraint - 

Assume,

A1 = Lx1 + Mx1 + Sx1

A2 = Lx2 + Mx2 + Sx2

A3 = Lx3 + Mx3 + Sx3
                        $$ (A1 / 750)* 100 $$
                        $$ (A2 / 900)* 100 $$
                        $$ (A3 / 450)* 100 $$

Non-negativity of decision variables - $$ (Lx1, Mx1, Sx1, Lx2, Mx2, Sx2, Lx3, Mx3 \hspace {.2cm} and \hspace {.2cm} Sx3)\ge 0 $$
